# Grooveshark-Refresh
Was beginning to build a new version of Grooveshark for Android 5.1 using their API. 

```On April 30, 2015, it was announced that, as part of a settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuits between the service and Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group, Grooveshark would be shut down immediately. ```

Unfortunately this meant the API was shut down as my project soon also would be. No big deal, however, this repositiory only impemented a login-screen.
